FUNCTION: dcoeff - Extract a coefficient in a linear partial differential 
                   equation ( LPDE )
      
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   dcoeff(e, dm)
      
PARAMETERS:
   e    - an expression
   dm   - a differential monomial
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The function dcoeffs considers e as a LPDE and returns the coefficient of
  the differential monomial dm.
   
- The expression e must be in collected form, see dcollect.
