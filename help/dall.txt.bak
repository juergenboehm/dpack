FUNCTION: makeDeterminingSystem - Compute the differential equations that have
								  as their solutions the infinitesimal
								  symmetries of a propounded system of
								  differential equations
      
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   makeDeterminingSystem(deqs, varLists, fns)
      
PARAMETERS:
   deqs 	- a list of differential equations
   varLists	- a list of two lists of variables
   fns		- a list of functions
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The function makeDeterminingSystem computes a system of linear partial
  differential equations in the functions given in fns.
  
- The solutions to these DEs are the infinitesimal symmetries of the DEs given
  in deqs.
  
- The parameter varLists contains the relevant variables for the propounded
  problem in form of a list of two sublists.
  The first sublist contains the independend variables of the problem, the 
  second the dependend ones ( compare the explanation at the dprolong help page ).
  
- For ease of input it is allowed that the members of the list of dependend
  variables in varLists are actually functions ( of the independend variables ).

- The functions in fns correspond to the variables in varLists according to
  the order in which they are written.
  Each function stands for the infinitesimal movement, that the corresponding
  variable is undergoing.
 
  That is if varLists = [[x],[y]] and fns = [xi(x,y), eta(x,y)], then the
  infinitesimal symmetries that the function tries to determine are sought under
  the form of
  
     xi * d/dx + eta * d/dy   ( read d-partial for d )

FUNCTION: makeJanetBase - computes the Janet-Base of a system of linear 
						  homogeneous partial differential equations ( LPDEs )
      
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   makeJanetBase(elist, fs)
      
PARAMETERS:
   elist	- a list of expressions
   fs   	- a list of functions of the same independent variables
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The function makeJanetBase considers elist as a list of LPDEs in the functions
  given in fs and returns the Janet-Base of these LPDEs
   
- Several global variables affect the operation of makeJanetBase. These are

	_spprocess		_spcoeff		_spfun
	_verbose
	_xvers
	
	_assertlist		_assumelist		_watchlist
	
	
  They have the following meaning :
  
  If _spcoeff is assigned a function, this function is applied to coefficients
  of the LPDEs during the computation. _spprocess should be assigned true in
  this case, unassigned otherwise.
  
  If _spfun is assigned a function, this function will be applied to the
  coefficients of LPDEs newly generated during the computation as so called
  integrability conditions.
  
  If _verbose is assigned true a certain amount of information about the ongoing
  computation is printed.
  
  If _xvers is assigned true a different method of autoreduction is employed 
  that seems advantageous on systems with large equations.
  		
  The following mechanism is intended for classification problems : 

  If _watchlist is assigned a list of expressions, preferably functions, a set
  of expressions is returned in _assumelist that must be <> 0 for the result of
  the Janet-Base computation to be correct.

  These expressions are coefficients or factors of coefficients that contain
  members of the list _watchlist, and are assumed <> 0 during the computation -
  typically leading coefficients or contents of the LPDEs.
  
  _assertlist is a list of expressions that are asserted beforehand to be <> 0 
  to avoid taking unnecessary elements into _assumelist.
  
  CAUTION 1 : _watchlist and _assertlist are lists, _assumelist is a set ( ! ).
  
  CAUTION 2 : _assumelist must be set to {} when activating this mechanism by
  	  setting  _watchlist to some value.
  	  
- The computation may take some time with problems of larger size.

FUNCTION: dxmakeJanetBase - computes a normal form of a system of linear or nonlinear
							differential equations
      
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   dxmakeJanetBase(eqlist, fs)
      
PARAMETERS:
   eqlist	- a list of expressions
   fs   	- a list of functions of the same independent variables
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The elements of elist are the differential equations represented in a special form
  as lists of six elements.
 
  This representation can be produced from a list of differential equations
  by the function dxmakeeql.
   
- Several global variables affect the operation of makeJanetBase. These are

	_verbose
	
	_minimalspace	_doeconsubs
	
	_dxfastmode

	_assertlist		_assumelist		_watchlist
	
	
	_eqsubsl	_dxaddlist
	
  They have the following meaning :
    
  If _verbose is assigned true a certain amount of information about the ongoing
  computation is printed.
  
  If _minimalspace is assigned true, certain expressions are reduced by convert[horner]
  during calculation.
  
  If _doeconsubs is assigned true, then certain substitutions are done in a way, that
  saves memory space.
  
  _mimimalspace and to a greater extent _doeconsubs tend to slow down the computation 
  when activated

  _dxfastmode when set to true allows for several reductions to be done without
  forcing resorting the list of equations by the head terms after each reduction. It tends
  to speed up the calculation when activated.

  The following mechanism is intended for classification problems : 

  If _watchlist is assigned a list of expressions, preferably functions, a set
  of expressions is returned in _assumelist that must be <> 0 for the result of
  the Janet-Base computation to be correct.

  These expressions are coefficients or factors of coefficients that contain
  members of the list _watchlist, and are assumed <> 0 during the computation -
  typically leading coefficients or contents of the LPDEs.
  
  _assertlist is a list of expressions that are asserted beforehand to be <> 0 
  to avoid taking unnecessary elements into _assumelist.
  
  CAUTION 1 : _watchlist and _assertlist are lists, _assumelist is a set ( ! ).
  
  CAUTION 2 : _assumelist must be set to {} when activating this mechanism by
  	  setting  _watchlist to some value.
  	  
  	  
  _eqsubsl is a list of substitutions applied to coefficient expressions, that is
  expressions not containing functions of fs, during calculation, to decide if
  they are zero.
  
  _dxaddlist is a list of substitutions applicable to functions from fs and their
  derivatives. They are applied during calculation and included as equations into
  the equations of eqlist.

- An order has to be fixed for the elements of fs by using the setcotes mechanism prior
  to the computation.

- The computation may take some time with problems of larger size.

FUNCTION: parmElim - computes an implicit representation of a parameterized 
					 family of functions by a system of differential equations
      
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   parmElim(eqlist, vars, parms)
      
PARAMETERS:
   eqlist	- a list of expressions
   vars   	- a list of variables
   parms	- a list of variables
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The function parmElim receives as its first argument a list of expressions of
  a special kind:
  
  These expressions have to be of the form
  
  		f(x,y,z,...)-g(x,y,z,...,a,b,c,...)
  		
  where f(x,y,z,...) is a function standing for itself and 
  g(x,y,z,...,a,b,c,...) stands for any expression involving the argument 
  variables.
  
  x,y,z,... are called the variables and are given in the argument vars.
  a,b,c,... are called the parameters and are given in the argument parms.
  
  What is given in this way is called a family of functions depending on the
  parameters a,b,c,...
  
- parmElim returns a list of differential equations in the f(x,y,z,...) that 
  have as their general solution exactly the family of functions given in eqlist.
  
- The algorithm is guaranteed to terminate when g(x,y,z,...,a,b,c,...) is
  linear in a,b,c,... , in the other cases it may either not terminate, stop 
  with error or give erroneous answers.

FUNCTION: vectfToDeq 	   - computes a representation by differential equations
							 for an explicitly given list of vectorfields

		  vectfToJanetBase - does afterwards additionally compute the Janet-Base
		  					 of these differential equations
      
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   vectfToDeq(vfList, fs)
   vectfToDeq(vfList, fs, vB )

   vectfToJanetBase(vfList, fs)
   vectfToJanetBase(vfList, fs, vB )
      
PARAMETERS:
   vfList	- a list of expressions
   fs   	- a list of functions
   vB		- (optional) a list of variables
         
SYNOPSIS:   
- The first argument vfList is a list of expressions of a special kind, 
  representing vectorfields.
  
  These expressions are linear in the auxiliary indetrminates p, q (default) or 
  in the indeterminates given by vB. Their coefficients are functions of the
  variables, on which the functions in fs depend.
  
  The meaning of such an expression f(x,y) * p + g(x,y) * q ( to take an example )
  is that of a vectorfield in the plane f(x,y) * d/dx + g(x,y) * d/dy, and
  analogously that of a vectorfield in n dimensions, when vB contains n
  auxiliary indeterminates and the functions in fs depend on n variables.
  
- The second argument is a list of functions depending on 2 ( default ) or as
  much variables, as are contained in vB.
  
- See also the help to vliebrack for the notation.
  
- Let [f1,..,fn] be fs. Then vectfToDeq computes a list of linear partial
  differential equations in the fi, so that the general solution to these DEs
  spans exactly the vectorspace generated by the list of vectorfields given in
  the argument vfList, that is
  
  f1 * p1 + ... + fn * pn
  
  takes all the values possible by linear combination ( with constant 
  coefficients ) of the vectorfields in vfList, when solutions of the 
  aforementioned DEs are inserted, and no other values.
  
- vectfToJanetBase simplifies the result from vectfToDeq by computing a 
  Janet-Base of these equations.
  
  CAUTION: in that case cotes must be assigned to the functions in fs.
  
- The reader might note this to be a special case of the computation done by
  parmElim

FUNCTION: vliebrack - computes the lie bracket of two vectorfields
    
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   vliebrack(vf1, vf2)
   vliebrack(vf1, vf2, vars)
   vliebrack(vf1, vf2, vars, vB)

      
PARAMETERS:
   vf1, vf2	- two expressions
   vars   	- (optional) a list of variables
   vB		- (optional) a list of variables
         
SYNOPSIS:   
- The arguments vf1, vf2 are two vectorfields given as linear expressions in
  a number of auxiliary indeterminates. These are by default p, q, but can
  be set otherwise by giving the argument vB to the function.

- Let p1,...,pn these indeterminates, f1,...,fn their coefficients.
  
  The expression
  
  	f1 * p1 + .... + fn * pn
  	
  is then meant to stand for the vectorfield in n dimensions
  
    f1 * d/dx1 + ... + fn * d/dxn  ( read delta for d )
    
  The fi are functions of n variables which are by default ( n = 2 ) assumed to
  be x, y, but can be set otherwise by giving the argument vars to vliebrack.

- The result is the lie-bracket of vf1 and vf2, given in the notation explained
  above:
  						
  [fi * pi, gj * pj] =  sum (fi *d(gj)/dxi - gi * d(fj)/dxi ) * pi
				        i=1..n, j= 1..n

FUNCTION: vliesubs - computes the representation of vectorfields after a change
					 of coordinates
    
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   vliesubs(vfl, vB, varsubs)
      
PARAMETERS:
   vfl 		- a list of expressions
   vB		- a list of variables
   varsubs	- a list of equations
         
SYNOPSIS:   
- The first argument is a list of vectorfields in the notation explained in
  the help to vectfToDeq and vliebrack.
  
- vB is the list of auxiliary indeterminates used in the abovementioned
  representation - note that on the contrary to e.g. vectfToDeq there are no
  default values for vB or the variables here.
  
- varsubs is a list of equations of the form

	variable = f(x,y,z,... )
	
  The variables on the left sides of the equations must be the old coordinates,
  in which the vectorfields in vfl are given, the right sides are the functions,
  by which these old coordinates have to be replaced.
  
  CAUTION: The functions on the right must depend on the variables of the left
  		   sides, that is, the names of the variables remain unchanged, which
  		   might be a bit uncommon, thinking for example of
  		   
  		   		x = r * cos(phi),	y= r * sin(phi)
  		   		
  		   	which must be written as
  		   	
  		   		x = x * cos(y),		y= x * sin(y)
  		   		
  		   	( or change x,y )
  		   	
- The function vliesubs returns the vectorfields in the new coordinates.

FUNCTION: structConst - computes the structure constants of an algebra of
						vectorfields

    
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   structConst(vfList, vars)
   structConst(vfList, vars, vB)
      
PARAMETERS:
   vfList 	- a list of expressions
   vars		- a list of variables
   vB		- (optional) a list of variables
         
SYNOPSIS:   
- vfList is a list of vectorfields in the notation explained in vectfToDeq or
  vliebrack.
  
- The vars which are the space-coordinates of the vectorfields are given in 
  vars, the auxiliary indeterminates in the optional argument vB. Default is 
  p, q, that is a vectorfield in the plane.
  Obviously vB and vars must have the same number of elements.
 
- The vectorfields in vfList must form a lie-algebra under the lie-bracket 
  ( this is not checked ) otherwise errors result or the answer is meaningless.
  
- The result is a table of three indices, giving the structure constants, that 
  is, if 
  
     vfList = [X1,...,Xn]
     
  then the result is C[i,j,k] with 1 <= i,j,k <= n and the relation
  
     ((Xi,Xj)) = sum C[i,j,k] * Xk
  			   k=1..n
  
  ((Xi,Xj)) meaning the lie-bracket of Xi, Xj.

- It is possible that the correct result will not be found, usually because the 
  expressions giving the vectorfields are too complicated to solve automatically
  for the C[i,j,k] in the defining equation above

FUNCTION: makeCommBase - to a given Janet-Base representation of a lie-algebra of
 						 vectorfields this function computes a system of 
 						 differential equations determining the commutator-algebra
 						 of this lie-algebra  

CALLING SEQUENCE:
   makeCommBase(jb, fs)
      
PARAMETERS:
   jb	- a list of expressions
   fs   - a list of functions of the same independent variables
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The expressions in jb must be a Janet-Base consisting of monic linear 
  homogeneous partial differential equations ( LPDEs ) in the functions in fs
  with a finite dimensional solution space, which is additionally a lie-algebra
  under the lie-bracket.
  
  Such systems of LPDEs arise for example as Determining Systems of the 
  symmetries of a differential equation.
  
  CAUTION : note the requirement for finite-dimensionality of the algebra and
  			monicity of the equations ( that is the coefficient of the leading
  			differential monomial must be 1 ).
  			
- Let X1,...,Xn be the generators of such a finite-dimensional lie-algebra, the
  commutator-algebra is the subalgebra generated by ((Xi,Xj)) ( ((-,-)) be the
  lie-bracket ).
  
- The result is a system of LPDEs but not a Janet-Base, a Janet-Base computation
  can be applied to the result to get it into canonical form and be able to read
  off properties sought after, like dimension of the algebra or its structure
  constants.

FUNCTION: inverseGrpBase - computes a Janet-Base or a representation by vectorfields
					for the inverse lie algebra ( inverse "group" ) of a lie algebra 
					of vectorfields 

CALLING SEQUENCE:
	inverseGrpBase ( vfl, vars, vB, fs, solve=true )
	
PARAMETERS:

	vfl		- a list of expressions
	vars	- a list of names ( optional )
	vB 		- a list of names ( same length as vars, optional )
	fs		- a list of functions
	solve=true	- parameter ( optional )

SYNOPSIS:
- vfl must be a list of vectorfields forming a lie algebra. They must be given in the
  notation described e.g. in the help page to 'vliebrack'. vars and vB take the
  same meaning as described there and have the same default values:
  
  	vars = [x,y]	vB=[p,q]
  	
- fs is a mandatory parameter consisting of functions of the variables in vars ( given
  or default [x,y] ), the number of which has to be equal the number of elements of
  vars. Each function corresponds the respective element of vars, and can be
  thought as standing for the respective unknown coordinate function in the 
  solution. That is if
  
  	vars = [x,y],	fs = [xi(x,y), eta(x,y)],	vB = [p,q]
  	
  then xi(x,y)*p+eta(x,y)*q is the assumed form of the vectorfields of the inverse
  lie algebra.

- The result is a Janet-Base in the functions from fs which has the inverse lie
  algebra to the given lie algebra as its solution.
  
  The term 'inverse lie algebra' of a lie algebra of vectorfields V1,...,Vn is
  meant to consist of all vectorfields Y with
  
  [Y, Vi] = ci1 * V1 + ... + cin * Vn
  
  for all i = 1,...,n   
  
- If solve=true is included ( alway as the last parameter ) then the equations 
  of the Janet-Base are solved and a base for the inverse lie algebra is returned.

FUNCTION: solvableRad - to a given Janet-Base representation of a lie-algebra of 
						vectorfields this function computes a system of 
						differential equations determining the solvable Radical 
						of this lie-algebra  

CALLING SEQUENCE:
   solvableRad(jb, fs)
      
PARAMETERS:
   jb	- a list of expressions
   fs   - a list of functions of the same independent variables
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The expressions in jb must be a Janet-Base consisting of monic linear 
  homogeneous partial differential equations ( LPDEs ) in the functions in fs
  with a finite dimensional solution space, which is additionally a lie-algebra
  under the lie-bracket.
  
  Such systems of LPDEs arise for example as Determining Systems of the 
  symmetries of a differential equation.
  
  CAUTION : note the requirement for finite-dimensionality of the algebra and
  			monicity of the equations ( that is the coefficient of the leading
  			differential monomial must be 1 ).
  			
- The solvable Radical of a lie-algebra is the union of all solvable 
  subalgebras.
  It is necessarily an ideal of the algebra, the quotient algebra is
  semi-simple.

- The result is a system of LPDEs but not a Janet-Base, a Janet-Base computation
  can be applied to the result to get it into canonical form and be able to read
  off properties sought after, like dimension of the algebra or its structure
  constants.

FUNCTION: dstructConst - to a given Janet-Base representation of a lie-algebra

CALLING SEQUENCE:

PARAMETERS:
   jb	- a list of expressions
   fs   - a list of functions of the same independent variables
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- The expressions in jb must be a Janet-Base consisting of monic linear 
  homogeneous partial differential equations ( LPDEs ) in the functions in fs 
  with a finite dimensional solution space, which is additionally a lie-algebra
  under the lie-bracket.
  
  Such systems of LPDEs arise for example as Determining Systems of the 
  symmetries of a differential equation.
  
  CAUTION : note the requirement for finite-dimensionality of the algebra and
  			monicity of the equations ( that is the coefficient of the leading
  			differential monomial must be 1 ).
  			
- The structure constants which are obtained are not constants in general but
  functions depending on the same variables on which the functions in fs depend,
  that are sought as solutions of the DEs which are given in jb.
  
  They give a valid aggregate of structure constants on each place, where they
  are all defined, and so can be thought of as a family of structure constants
  depending on the place.
  
- Note that it is not necessary to be able to solve the DEs in the Janet-Base
  for obtaining the structure constants.

                      (LPDE ) according to an order specified by a matrix of
                      cotes
   
          dsortraw  - sorts the terms of a linear partial differential equation
                      (LPDE ) according to total degree order
      
          dsortlist - sorts a list of LPDE according to a cote order
      
      
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   dsort(e, fs)
   dsortraw(e, fs)
   dsortlist(le, fs)
      
PARAMETERS:
   e     - an expression
   le    - a list of expressions
   fs    - a list of functions of the same independent variables
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- dsort and dsortraw consider e as an LPDE with respect to the functions given
  in fs.   
     
- dsortlist first sorts every equation in the list le by applying dsort, and 
  then sorts the list by the leading differential monomials of its equations.
     
- To use dsort or dsortlist it is necessary to have a cote order associated
  with fs by using the function setcotes. The function dsortraw on the opposite
  works on every LPDE.

FUNCTION: getliealg - returns lie algebra of specified lie-number 
   
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   getliealg ( lienr, ldim )
      
PARAMETERS:
   lienr	- an integer
   ldim		- ( optional ) an integer
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- There exists a standard numbering of the 27 lie algebra types occuring as transformation
  groups of the plane, which is given e.g. in 
 
 	Lie, Gesammelte Abhandlungen, V. Band, 1.Abt, S. 248 ff.
 	
- This function returns for a given lie number ( parameter lienr ) the lie algebra belonging
  to it. Some lie algebra numbers actually specify a series of infinitely many lie algebras.
  In these cases it is compulsory to give the dimension of the lie algebra by using ldim. 
  In some cases several lie algebras fall under a combination of lienr / ldim and will be 
  returned alltogether as elements of a list.
  
- The lie algebra itself is given in the standard form described by Lie and in the
  notation for vectorfields explained in connection with the 'vliebrack' function.

FUNCTION: invariantEquation - returns the two lowest invariants of a transformation group
								of the plane 
   
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   invariantEquation ( veclist, vBLists, varLists )
      
PARAMETERS:
   veclist		- a list of expressions
   vBLists		- a list of two lists of indeterminates
   varLists		- a list of two lists of variables 
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- veclist is a list of vectorfields in the notation described in connnection with
  'makeDeterminingSystem' and 'dprolong'. vBLists and varLists are the accompanying
  systems of indeterminates and variables.
  
- The function computes the two lowest differential invariants phi1, phi2 of the lie-algebra
  of transformations given by veclist.
  
- This function works only in connection with the package pdetools.

FUNCTION: lowerEquation - returns lower Equation of a transformation group of 
							the plane 
   
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   lowerEquation ( veclist, vBLists, varLists )
      
PARAMETERS:
   veclist		- a list of expressions
   vBLists		- a list of two lists of indeterminates
   varLists		- a list of two lists of variables 
      
SYNOPSIS:   
- veclist gives a list of vectorfields in the notation described in connnection with
  'makeDeterminingSystem' and 'dprolong'. vBLists and varLists are the accompanying
  systems of indeterminates and variables.
  
- The function computes the lower Equation of the lie-algebra of transformations given
  by veclist.

FUNCTION: dprolong - compute the prolongation of a vectorfield
   
CALLING SEQUENCE:
   dprolong ( vec, vBLists, varLists, order )
      
PARAMETERS:
   vec			- a list of expressions
   vBLists		- a list of two lists of indeterminates
   varLists		- a list of two lists of variables 
   order		- an integer
     
SYNOPSIS:   
- The parameter vec contains a vectorfield of order zero in the notation decribed in
  the help pages for vliebrack etc.
  vBLists and varLists are the accompanying systems of indeterminates and variables,
  written in a notation which reflects the distinction between variables that are
  thought as independent and those that are thought as dependent, e.g. for a 
  vectorfield in the plane
  
  vec = x*p+y*q
  vBLists = [[p],[q]]
  varLists = [[x],[y]]
  
  The second list contains the variables thought as dependent, the first those
  that are thought as independent.
  
- The function computes the prolongation of the vectorfield up to the order given
  in the parameter order.
  
- CAUTION : dprolong accepts only vectorfields of zeroth order ( unprolonged vector-
	fields )
