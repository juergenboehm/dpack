1. Introduction
   ============
   
   dpack is a collection of routines for maple (currently maple8)
   which are intended for calculations in the context of symmetries
   of differential equations.
   Specifically the system contains code for solving a great variety
   of ODEs up to order 3 by symmetry analysis.

2. Installation and Use
   ====================

   UNIX/Linux
   ==========
   
   Let us assume that /home/yourname is your home directory ($HOME)
   
   Then do the following:
   
   1. create one after the other the following directories:
   
   /home/yourname/maple
   /home/yourname/maple/packages
   
   if they don't exist yet.
   
   2. copy dpack.tar.gz into /home/yourname/maple/packages
   3. cd /home/yourname/maple/packages
   4. gunzip dpack.tar.gz
   5. tar -xvf dpack.tar
   
   Now a subdirectory dpack exists in /home/yourname/maple/packages
   cd into this directory.
   
   6. Open the file readdpack into an editor of your choice.
   7. Replace /home/juergen/maple at the beginning of readdpack by
   /home/yourname/maple
   8. Now the distribution is ready to be used in maple.
   
   For using it, enter at any time in your maple session the command:
   
      
	  read `/home/yourname/maple/packages/dpack/readdpack`;
   
   (or use any other accessible path ending in dpack/readdpack)
   
   Windows
   =======
   
   It should be easy to adapt dpack to a Windows version of maple, but
   at current there was no demand for it.
   
=====================================================================

3. Documentation
   =============
   
   At the moment there is not much documentation. The subdirectory
   examples/ contains worksheets demonstrating certain capabilities of
   the system:
   
   dpack-overview-1.mws
   
   contains computations of the determining system for the symmetries of
   several ODEs and PDEs together with solutions for these determining
   systems.
   
   dpack-overview-2.mws
   
   contains an example of LPDE system factorization by the eigenring
   method invented by Singer and extended by van Hoeij. I extended it to
   LPDEs at the end of 1997.
   
   dpack-overview-3.mws
   
   contains an example of LPDE system factorization by a different method,
   which is similar to a method Dr. Schwarz described for ODEs in 1989 and was
   developed by me at the end of 1999.
   
   Additionally there exist maple help pages for certain functions
   of the dapck system, but they cover only a small portion of the systems
   functions.
   
   You can try
   
   ?dpack
   
   to get an overview (warning: the help(dpack,...) calls mentioned there
   are not implemented yet).
   
   and for some important examples
   
   ?makeJanetBase
   ?makeDeterminingSystem
   ?dprolong
   ?vectfToDeq
   
   see the help/ subdirectory of dpack/ for a list of all implemented help
   pages. All *functionname*.hlp files can be called up in maple by
   ?*functionname*
   
   If you are interested in using the system and are in need of more
   information, please write me (see e-mail above) and describe, what you
   intend to do. I will then supply the necessary information. (This is easier
   for me, than writing a bulky documentation in advance without knowing
   if anyone will read it).
